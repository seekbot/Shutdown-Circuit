# Shutdown-Circuit
The Shutdown Circuit (SDC), now more commonly known as the high voltage (HV) and low voltage (LV) shutdown boards (SDBs), controls shutting down the vehicle in the occurance of a fault. Accordingly, the HV SDB is located in the HV system, and the LV SDB is in the LV system where if a fault were detected in either system then the vehicle turns off completely.
